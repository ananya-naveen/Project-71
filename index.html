            <p class="text-muted text-left">I visited the classroom next to mine in 2nd grade which was in the year 2017(4 years ago) due to some problem in our class. The classroom was empty upon entering it because the students of that class were in the school ground for PE. Our math teacher left us for a moment and left a cleaning staff member to maintain us. My class is usally called the most troubelsome and talkative class in the whole elementary section. So one of my classmate along with the guy that was left to maintain us cracked a joke. The whole class started laughing and it was funny for the guy in the start, but later after about 5 minutes later he got tired of hearing 45 children aged 7 and 8 laughing hysterically. He made some students stand right next to the door and the whole class got quite. But "someone" decided to let out a snicker and whenever I heard somebody laugh I laugh, I just cound'nt help it. So I left out a snicker and instead of catching the actual culprit, he caught me :( then I was very humiliated to be made to stand up next to the door becuase I am not used to it. My math teacher came back, was very disapointed in me as she did not expect me to get in trouble.</p>

            <p class="text-muted text-left">I visited the cafeteria once in the 5th grade a year back. I went to my school for my tests and normal classes for a month(mainly for the tests), so after the test they took classes, so there was lunch break in the middle. My mom always gives me lunchboxes, becuase it is obvious she loves me and my brother. So, once I forgot my lunch bag which happens rarely or never because I love food! My friend gave me some of her money to buy lunch, so I bought some in the cafeteria. The problem was I bumped into someone. Guess who it was....My 4th grade social science teacher. She is the strictest teacher me and my classmates ever had. She lecturted me for not watching where I was going :(.</p>

            <p class="text-muted text-left">I visited the library many times before. But this one particular visit when I was in the 3rd grade is special. We were given away a few books which were by famous writers. I already read the book given to me, so I asked the teacher for another book after stating why. The teacher allowed me to pick another book from the pile she had. Seeing this one of the girls in my class asked my teacher if she could pick another book. My teacher asked why and she said she did not like it, to that my teacher replied that "No, you can't pick another book just because you don't like it". The girl asked why. My teacher just told her to be quiet. One of the guys in my class made a joke about it. Everybody in my class started laughing other than a few kids. I did not laugh because I rather felt bad for her.</p>
